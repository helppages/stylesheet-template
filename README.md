# Stylesheet Template
This is a complete stylesheet template for theming your HelpPag.es documentation.  Also included is a test html file that loads the same initial styles as the site.  It should be everything you need to get going.

## Considerations
Just a few basic rules:

 * You can only have one stylesheet included in your repo
    * If you include multiple, the last one will always overwrite the previous ones
 * Be nice, these are your users, don't do anything shady

## How to use
Download the repo, launch the test/index.html file and start editing the stylesheet.css file.  Once your'e done, drop it in your documentation repo and push it up.  We'll take care of the rest.

## Contributing
Right now the css file is just the css from our Minimal theme.  It'll definitely be fleshed out better over time.  If you have some useful additions, please submit a pull request and we'll merge it in for everyone to use.
